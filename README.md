# Predicting-NYC-Illegal-Conversions

The goal of this project was to label buildings in New York City that are at high risk of an illegal conversion. An illegal conversion occurs when an existing residential or commercial building is altered or modified to create an additional room, space, or unit without first getting approval from the Department of Buildings (DOB). Illegal conversions therefore often do not complying with Building and Fire Code. Many deaths are caused by illegal conversions because the illegally converted room or unit is often located in a cellar or attic that lack a second egress to escape. Hurricane Ida caused eleven deaths in basement apartments, at least five of the apartments were illegall converted:
